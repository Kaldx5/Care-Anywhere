# Care Anywhere – Mobile Car Repair Shop
## 2022-2023 projects.
## Project Overview
**Care Anywhere** is a mobile car repair service operating 24/7 in Dubai, Sharjah, and Ajman in the UAE. The company offers a fully-equipped van designed to function as a complete mobile workshop. I was responsible for developing the company's website and managing their Google Ads campaigns, which led to significant engagement and customer growth. Unfortunately, due to health issues, I had to step away from the project.

## Features
- **24/7 Availability**: The repair service is available around the clock, providing convenience to customers who need immediate assistance.
- **Mobile Workshop**: The company’s vans are fully equipped with tools and parts needed for most vehicle repairs, eliminating the need for customers to visit a traditional garage.
- **Website Development**: I designed and developed a responsive website to promote the company and facilitate customer interaction.
- **Google Ads Management**: I created and managed Google Ads campaigns that successfully attracted a significant number of customers and inquiries.
  
## Technologies Used
- **Website Builder: Wix (Customized templates and designs to meet the business requirements)
- **Marketing & Ads: Google Ads (Pay-Per-Click campaigns)
- **Social Media: Managed basic integration with Google My Business and social platforms for increased visibility

## My Role
- **Website Development**: Designed and built a responsive, user-friendly website for the business.
- **Marketing**: Managed successful Google Ads campaigns that boosted visibility and customer engagement.
  
## Challenges
- Initially, the business faced internal operational challenges, which impacted their ability to scale and provide consistent service.
- Due to health reasons, I had to step back from the project, which left the team to manage the business operations and marketing efforts on their own.

## Outcome
- **Website Impact**: The website received positive feedback for its user-friendly interface, and it helped the company gain more visibility in the UAE market.
- **Ads Success**: The Google Ads campaign brought significant traffic to the website, contributing to a growing customer base during the initial phases.
  
## Future Improvements (If I continued)
- **App Development**: I envisioned creating a mobile app for easier booking and service tracking.
- **Advanced Customer Feedback System**: Integrating a review and feedback system to continuously improve service.
- **CRM Integration**: Implementing a customer relationship management (CRM) tool to streamline operations and improve client interactions.
